# Community to Raid (Addon for World of Warcraft) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Mass invitation for communities to raid groups made easy. 
Invite all online players in a community to your raid group with one single command:

> /invitetoraid <community name>

## Considerations
Take into account that you will only be able to run as many invitations as empty places in your group! 
If your entire first invitation wave is rejected, maybe you will need to manually create a group before trying mass invitation again.
